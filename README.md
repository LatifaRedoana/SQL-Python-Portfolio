# SQL-Python-Portfolio
Welcome to my personal SQL portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects and queries I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in database management, data analysis, and data manipulation using SQL.

## About me
I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong background in python and  SQL. Over the years, I have honed my skills in designing and optimizing databases, writing complex queries, and leveraging SQL's powerful features to extract meaningful insights from data. This portfolio serves as a testament to my proficiency in SQL and demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world data challenges with collaboration python and SQL.

## SQL Projects
In this repository, you will find a variety of SQL with Python projects, including:

### Order Data analysis project:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation with python:
   - Handling missing values
   - Rename column name-- make lower case and replace space with under score
   - create new column discount, sale_price and profit
   - convert order date from object type to date time
   - drop the column cost price, list price, discount
   - clean DataFrame uploaded to MySQL
     
2. Data analysis with MySQL: This project revolves around the exploration and analysis the customer orders with finding out the following questions:
     - Q1: find top 10 highest revenue generating products
     - Q2: Top 5 highest selling products in each region
     - Q3: find month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sale (eg: jan 2022 vs jan 2023)
     - Q4: For each catagory which month had highest sales
     - Q5: which sub category had highest growth by profit in 2023 compare to 2022
  
       
  ### Netflix Data Analysis Project:
  1. Data Extraction with Python: Overview of the dataset, the process of retrieving and preparing Netflix data for analysis using Python
     - Reading Netflix Dataset
     - Cleaning and Parsing Data
     - Data Extraction: Extracting year, month from date_added
     - Exporting Clean Data
  2. Data Analysis with MySQL: This repository processed netflix data using SQL to create a database for easy management and analysis. It contains valuable insights and visualizations derived from a comprehensive covering TVshows and movies of several director. 
- Data cleaning:
  - Remove duplicates: find out which show_id's are duplicated and how many times
  - create new table for several values listed in one column(director, country, cast)
  - data type conversion for date added
  - final table after data cleaning: five tables including raw tables
  - populate missing values in country, duration columns
- Find out the following question of valuable insights
  - Q1: For each director count the no. of movies and TV shows created by them, for each director who have created TV shows and movies both
  - Q2: which country has highest number of comedy movies?
  - Q3: for each year (as per date added to the netflix), which director has maximum no. of movies released
  - Q4: What is the average duration of movies in each genre
  - 5: Find the list of director who have created comedy and horror movie both.
